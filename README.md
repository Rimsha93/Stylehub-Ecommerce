StyleHub — Modern eCommerce landing page
A clean, responsive single-page HTML storefront built with Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome. Images are stored in the uploads folder.

🚀 Quick Start
Open the site: double-click ecommerce.html or open it in your browser.
Or run a simple local server (recommended for proper asset loading):
Python: python -m http.server 8000 → visit http://localhost:8000/ecommerce.html
Node (http-server): npx http-server -p 8000 → visit http://localhost:8000/ecommerce.html
🔧 Project Structure
ecommerce.html — Main single-page site
uploads — All images used in the page (e.g., home.jpg, about.jpg, product images)
🧩 Tech & Assets
Bootstrap 5 (CDN)
Google Font: Poppins (CDN)
Font Awesome (CDN)
Images: located in uploads (see: home.jpg, about.jpg, 1.jpg, 2.jpg, ..., etc.)
⚙️ Features

✍️ How to edit
HTML and styles are in ecommerce.html. CSS is inline in the <style> block for quick edits.
Replace or add images in uploads and update the src attributes where needed.
📦 Suggestions for improvements
Split CSS/JS into separate files for maintainability.
Add a build toolchain (npm, bundler) if adding more assets.
Convert ecommerce into a backend (API/cart) if dynamic behavior is required.
Note: Contact details shown in the site are sample content (e.g., info@stylehub.com). Replace with real data before production.
